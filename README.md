# Code 1.96 – The Fractal Law of Memory Geometry and Cosmic Resonance

A unified tensor field theory proposing Ψₘₙ as a static, divergence-free geometric replacement for both dark matter and dark energy. The model predicts fractal cosmic structure (Hausdorff dᴴ ≈ 1.96), 0.12 Hz gravitational wave echoes, and biological field resonance correlations.

## Summary

This framework introduces a rank-2 tensor field Ψₘₙ as an alternative to the cosmological constant (Λ), offering:

- A purely geometric modification to Einstein’s field equations  
- No need for particulate dark matter or scalar dark energy fields  
- Fractal projection structure across cosmic and biological scales  
- Predictive resonance geometry with falsifiable observational claims

## Core Predictions

- Gravitational wave echo band: ~0.12 Hz  
- Fractal cosmic void structure: dᴴ ≈ 1.96  
- Rotation curve fits (no exotic mass)  
- Chromatin folding aligned with geometric field constraints  
- Biological and cosmological scale resonance coupling
